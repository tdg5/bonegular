### Backbone-Inspired Models and Collections for Angular

<img style="float: right; width: 125px; margin-left: 20px;" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/832215/bonegular.png" />

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) is a fantastic client-side framework. It solves a lot of problems, but provides little to no guidance in terms of how one might best go about structuring the underlying data of an application. I tried [$resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource) and [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular), but they weren't really "doing it for me." I found myself longing for something more akin to the Collection and Model classes that you find in [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org). Click, click. Tap, tap. Voila... Bonegular. Makes perfect sense.

This is an alpha release. The API could change a little, but I'm already using this in production and it works great.

# Examples <a name="examples"></a>

Bonegular works well with a number of back-end storage solutions, including traditional "relational" databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL) and so-called "NoSQL" document stores (e.g. MongoDB, CouchDB):

* [Document Stores (MongoDB)](#document)

## MongoDB <a name="document"></a>

### Back-end Data

In this example, let's assume that your application's data resides within one or more MongoDB "collections." These collections likely contain one or more nested "sub-documents," as shown in the following example schema:

```
var School = {
	'name': {
		'type': String
	},
	'students': [
        {
	        'first_name': {
		        'type': String
	        },
	        'last_name': {
		        'type': String
	        }
        }
	]
};
```

As you can see, we have one primary document here - ```School```. Beneath this document's ```students``` key, lives an array of sub-documents representing students. Let's assume that our application provides REST endpoints to the ```School``` resource as shown below:

```
GET: /api/schools - Returns all schools.
POST: /api/schools - Creates a new school.
GET: /api/schools/:school_id - Returns a specific school.
GET: /api/schools/:school_id/students - Returns the students for a specific school.
POST: /api/schools/:school_id/students - Creates a new student within a specific school.
```

### Configuring Bonegular

To model this within Bonegular, we'll want to create two collections (Schools, Students) and two models (School, Student). A relationship exists between schools and students (students belong to schools). Notice how in the following examples we define these objects within reusable Angular "services."

#### The "School" Model
```
app.factory('School', function(bonegular, Students) {
    return bonegular.createModel({
    	'collections': {
    		'students': Students
    	},
		'methods': {}
    });
});
```

#### The "Student" Model
```
app.factory('Student', function(bonegular) {
    return bonegular.createModel({
		'methods': {}
    });
});
```

#### The "Schools" Collection
```
app.factory('Schools', function(bonegular) {
	return bonegular.createCollection({
		'url': '/api/schools',
		'methods': {}
	});
});
```

#### The "Students" Collection
```
app.factory('Schools', function(bonegular) {
	return bonegular.createCollection({
		'url': 'schools',
		'methods': {}
	});
});
```

### Using Them

Now that we've defined our models and collections, we can use them:


```
app.controller('DefaultController', function($scope, Schools) {

	var schools = new Schools();
	
	/**
	 * Executes a GET against /api/schools
	 */
	schools.get().then(function() {
	
		// Loop through our students collection.
		schools.students.each(function(student) {
		});
		
		// Executes a POST against /api/schools/:school_id/students
		schools.students.create({
			'first_name': 'John',
			'last_name': 'Doe'
		}).then(function(student) {
			// Our new student was created.
		});

	});

});
```
